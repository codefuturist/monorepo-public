# Archived Scripts

This directory contains scripts that have been archived due to issues or obsolescence.

## Files

- **`enable-ssh-password.sh.broken`** - Original version that was missing the actual configuration modification step. Script would create backup and restart SSH but never actually enable password authentication.

## Note

Archived scripts are kept for reference but should not be used in production. Check the main script directories for current, working versions.
